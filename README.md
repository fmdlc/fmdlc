Hi, I'm Facu. I am a Lead of Site Reliability Engineering actually working in <a href="http://github.com/asappinc>@ASAPP</a>.
I have been the last 12 years implementing, hardening, designing and building IT infrastructure for critical and load intensive environments.
I love hacking things like Unix systems, TCP/IP networks, cloud computing scenarios, and actually GitOps pipelines in order to build the next level of highly available, resilient and trusted infrastructure.
In other activities, I participated as a speaker at numerous conferences raising issues mostly focused on the exploitation of vulnerabilities, kernel hacking, Unix hardening, Cloud Computing, and low-level programming.
